# ApiQuest UI Docs

ApiQuest UI is a local desktop client focused on fast editing, rich execution feedback,
and plugin-driven extensibility. No cloud accounts and no remote storage — your work stays
private on disk, with Git-based collaboration.

## Highlights

- Local, private storage with no cloud account required, no login ever
- Git integration for collaboration
- Console panel with execution timeline and errors
- Persistent workspace state across sessions
- Plugin hook points for request editors and response viewers
- Vault-backed variables via plugins (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, and more)
